*Dropping observations for people age < 18 and metropolitan status not identified
drop if a_age < 18

*Creating new variable indicating attendance at college or not
gen college=0 

*Finding out the numeric variable given to each label for a_hga - Educational attainment
tab a_hga, nolabel
*Fill in new variable with 1 if the person attended college - uses numeric values from a_hga
replace college=1 if inlist(a_hga, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46)

*Label it college or no college by first creating a value label
label define college_label 0 "No College" 1 "College" 
* then associating the value label with the college variable
label values college college_label

*DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS - TABLES AND CHARTS
*Table showing college attendance by gender and % of attendance of each group
tab college a_sex, col

*Probability illustration with pie charts
* I was unable to find the code to add title to the graph so I used the Graph Editor tool in Stata to complete that step
graph pie a_sex if a_sex==1, over(college) plabel(_all percent, size(*1.5) color(white)) 
graph pie a_sex if a_sex==2, over(college) plabel(_all percent, size(*1.5) color(white)) 
	
*Joint Probability table for the sample
tab college a_sex, cell

*Rejection region
twoway (function y = tden(135750,x), range(-1.96 1.96) color(red) recast(area))
